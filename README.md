# LogFileAnalyzer
The LogFileAnalyzer is a Python-based application designed to analyze log files and detect suspicious activities such as unauthorized access, failed logins, privilege escalation, phishing attempts, file tampering, and potential security breaches.
This tool works across Windows, macOS, and Linux and provides a clear report with graphical visualizations for better interpretation of log data.

# Features

Analyze Windows Security logs for suspicious activities
Detect failed login attempts, explicit credential usage, and privilege escalation
Generate a summary report in text and CSV formats
Provide graphical visualization of detected issues (bar charts, histograms, pie charts)
Allow users to extend detection patterns and remedies

# Requirements

Python 3.x
Use a virtual environment
Required Python Libraries
pandas
matplotlib
numpy
seaborn

# Installation

# Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/LogFileAnalyzer.git
